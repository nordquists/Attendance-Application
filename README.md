# Attendance-Application
An application that I created and documented to serve as an attendance application for my high school.

## Structure
The application is made up of three subapplications:
1. iOS application written in Swift
2. MacOS application written in Swift
3. Middleware Server written in Python (also a PostgreSQL database)
